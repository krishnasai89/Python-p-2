we need to download two important packages for this application.

Open your terminal and run the following command
- gtts(google text-to-speech):
```terminal
pip install gtts
```
- playsound:
```terminal
pip install playsound
```
*Now that we have the packages, we are ready to import it in our python script.*
```py
import gtts ,playsound
```
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):
*gTTS is a Python library that makes it incredibly easy to convert text into audio. It interfaces with Google Translateâ€™s text-to-speech API.*
*You can use it to generate spoken MP3 data, which you can then save to a file or manipulate further.*
*Some cool features of gTTS include customizable sentence tokenization, as well as customizable text pre-processors.*
- playsound:
*he playsound module is used to play audio files in Python.*
*With just a single line of code, you can play a sound file.*
