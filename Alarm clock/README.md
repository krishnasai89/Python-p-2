## Installing required python packages 

```terminal
pip install pygame
```
*Now that we have the packages, we are ready to import it in our python script.*
```py
from time import sleep 
```

# Pygame offers a bunch of cool features:

 # Graphics: 
    Create dynamic 2D graphics with ease. Think images, rectangles, and even polygon shapes.

 # Sound: 
    Add sound effects and background music effortlessly.

# Setting the Scene: 

Imagine you’re programming this script while sipping a cup of chai or coffee. The room is dimly lit, and outside, the world is still waking up. You type away, creating your own little time-travel device—one that catapults you from dreamland to reality. Ready? Let’s go!

# The set_alarm Function: 

This function is the heart of your script. It takes an alarm_time as input (in the format HH:MM:ss) and sets up a loop. Inside that loop, it continuously checks the current time. When the current time matches the alarm time, it shouts, “WAKE UP!🥱” and plays an alarm sound. I imagine it’s a gentle chime, like the one you’d hear in a cozy vintage clock.

# The Countdown: 

As the seconds tick by, your script keeps checking if it’s time to wake someone from their slumber. It’s like a diligent but friendly guardian, whispering, “Not yet… not yet… Ah, now!” And then—boom!—the alarm goes off, jolting you awake. 

# The Soundtrack: 

You’ve got an alarm.mp3 file tucked away somewhere. Maybe it’s a classic beep-beep-beep or a soothing melody. Either way, it’s your personal wake-up anthem.

# The Loop: 

Your script doesn’t quit until the alarm sound finishes playing. It’s persistent, like a dog nudging you to take it for a walk.

# User Interaction: 

Finally, you prompt the user to input their desired alarm time. They type it in, and your script takes over. It’s like handing the conductor’s baton to an invisible maestro.
