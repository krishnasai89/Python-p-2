# CountDown Timer
## Installing required python packages 

```terminal
pip install time
```
*Now that we have the packages, we are ready to import it in our python script.*
```py
from time import sleep
```
### - You’ve got your baton ready: 

*You’ve imported the time module—nice choice! It’s like having a trusty metronome for your seconds.*

### Setting the tempo: 

*You’re asking the user to input a time in seconds. So, they’re the composer, and you’re here to play their tune.*

### The countdown begins: 

*You’re looping through the seconds, gracefully subtracting one beat at a time. 🕰️*

### Harmony in seconds: 

*With each iteration, you’re calculating the remaining seconds and printing them out. It’s like watching a digital clock tick away.*

### Grand finale: 

*And just when the last note plays, you declare, “TIME’S UP!” 🎉 Applause, please!*
