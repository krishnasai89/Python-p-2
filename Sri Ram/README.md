### - Turtle Graphics: 

*The turtle module in Python allows you to create drawings and graphics using a virtual turtle that moves around the screen. It’s a fun way to introduce programming concepts to beginners.*

### - Title and Background Color: 

*You’ve set the title of your turtle graphics window to “Jai Shree Ram” (which means “Hail Lord Rama” in Hindi). And the background color is black, creating a dramatic backdrop for your artwork.*

### - Drawing the Circular Arrangement:

- *You’ve defined a list called Ram_name with a single element: "జై శ్రీరామ్."*

- *The angle variable is calculated as 360 divided by 49.*

- *The turtle starts by lifting its pen (penup()), moving down slightly (sety(-1)), and then proceeds to draw the circular arrangement.*

- *For each iteration, it turns left by the specified angle, moves forward by 260 units (presumably to the outer edge of the circle), writes the corresponding element from Ram_name, and then moves back to the center.*

- *The font used for the text is Arial, bold, and size 12.*

### - Color and Pen Size: 

*The turtle’s pen color is orange, and the pen size is set to 6.*
