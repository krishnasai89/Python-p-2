## *Now that we have the packages, we are ready to import it in our python script.*

```py
import random
```

### - Take User Input: 

*Prompt the user to choose how many six-sided dice they’d like to roll. You can use Python’s built-in input() function for this.*

### - Parse and Validate Input: 

*Ensure the user provides a valid integer from 1 to 6 (inclusive).*

### - Simulate Dice Rolls: 

*Use Python’s random.randint() to simulate the rolling events.*

### - Generate ASCII Diagram: 

- *Display an ASCII representation of the dice faces after each roll.*


- *You have used a dictionary dic_art to store the graphical representation of each dice face. This is a good approach.*

- *You have used a for loop to generate the random numbers for each dice and store them in a list dice. This is a good way to simulate the rolling of multiple dice.*

- *You have used another for loop to print the graphical representation of each dice face. This is a good way to display the result.*
